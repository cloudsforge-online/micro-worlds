# Build context is this repository, plus two named contexts for the unpublished sibling packages:
#
#   docker build -t settlement \
#     --build-context runtimepkgs=../runtime \
#     --build-context contractpkgs=../contracts .
#
# Both extra contexts are temporary. Once the @cloudsforge/* packages are published (AD-02),
# package.json takes registry versions, the COPY lines marked below are deleted, the flags go away,
# and this becomes an ordinary single-context build. Nothing else changes.
#
# They are named `runtimepkgs`/`contractpkgs` rather than `runtime`/`contracts` because a build
# context and a build stage share one namespace, and the final stage below is called `runtime`.

# Temporary: the file:/link: dependencies resolve to ../runtime and ../contracts relative to this
# directory, so the packages must exist at those paths inside the image for the lockfile to stay
# frozen. `link:` in particular resolves at install time to the sibling's own node_modules, which
# is why the contracts context carries its packages' manifests as well as their sources.

# service in the estate already does. What this stage buys is that a type error fails the image
# build instead of the first request.

# The health endpoints are for the orchestrator, not for the image: the balancer probes /readyz and

# then drifts.

# The migrator is a SEPARATE one-shot process — `node --import tsx src/migrator.ts` — run as an
# init container or a Kubernetes Job before this ever starts. It is deliberately not invoked here:
# below SCHEMA_VERSION the partial unique index `outbound_in_flight_uniq` may not exist, and it is
# what makes two in-flight transactions on one chain impossible. A service that could create it at
# boot is a service that could start without it — two workers signing against one nonce with
# nothing between them. `index.ts` asserts the schema version and refuses to serve below it.
