/**
 * The one-shot migrator.
 *
 * A separate process, run as an init container or a Kubernetes Job, and **never** called from
 * `index.ts`. Three reasons, in increasing order of seriousness:
 *
 *   1. A slow migration would stall every service that waits on this one's health.
 *   2. Two replicas booting together race on `pg_type`, one raises 23505 and crash-loops — which
 *      is why the estate cannot scale a service past one replica today.
 *   3. Migrating from inside the service means the service decides when the schema changes, so a
 *      rollback of the image is not a rollback of the database.
 *
 * Safe to run concurrently from N processes: `@cloudsforge/db` serialises them on an advisory
 * lock derived from the service name, and the losers observe an empty pending set.
