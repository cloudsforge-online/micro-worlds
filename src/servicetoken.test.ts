/**
 * **The ten-minute cliff, end to end, through the wiring this service actually uses.**
 *
 * `@cloudsforge/auth` proves the provider in isolation. This file proves the ADOPTION, which is a
 * different claim and the one that was wrong here.
 *
 *     const token = () => env.serviceToken        // src/index.ts, before this change
 *
 * A string read once at boot, from a token that expires in 600 seconds
 * (identity/src/tokens.ts:28), which nothing could re-mint because minting required the `admin`
 * role. Every peer call in this service began failing ten minutes into every deployment.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE COULD NOT SEE IT, AND WHY THIS FILE IS SHAPED AS IT IS. Every other test here
 * builds a client against a fake peer and calls it immediately. A token minted at the top of such
 * a test is seconds old when it is used, so it is never asked to survive its own lifetime. **A
 * test that mints a token and immediately uses it proves nothing about this defect.** The test
 * below moves a simulated clock eleven minutes past a token it already holds, asserts that token
 * is now REFUSED BY A REAL `Verifier`, and only then asserts the client still works.
 *
 * It goes through the real `buildUpstreams` — not a hand-rolled provider — because "the provider
 * is correct" and "the provider is wired in" are separate failures, and only the second one was
 * ever the bug here.
 *
 * THE CLOCK IS SIMULATED, NOT WAITED ON. `mock.timers` moves `Date` only; jose decides expiry from
 * `Date.now()`, so an eleven-minute jump is indistinguishable to it from eleven real minutes.
 * `setTimeout` is deliberately NOT mocked — the provider awaits promises that real timers settle.
